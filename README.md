# Introduction

[Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard) is a single data panel display that almost fully utilizes data from Copilot APIs, The APIs used are:

- [List teams of an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams)
- [Get Copilot user usage metrics (latest 28-day report)](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics?apiVersion=2026-03-10#get-copilot-users-usage-metrics)
- [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization)
- [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization)
- [Get enterprise billing usage reports](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/enterprise-admin/billing?apiVersion=2026-03-10)

representing Copilot usage in multi organizations & teams from different dimensions. The features are summarized as follows:
- Data is persisted in Elasticsearch and visualized in Grafana, **not just the past 28 days**. So you can freely choose the time period you want to visualize, such as the past year or a specific month.
- You can freely adjust the style and theme of the chart, everything is a mature feature of Grafana.
- All stored data includes Organization and Team fields, which is convenient for data filtering through variable filters.
- Generate a unique hash key for each piece of data, and update the stored data every time the latest data is obtained.
- Visualizations in Grafana dashboards can be adjusted or deleted according to actual needs.
- Based on Grafana's built-in alerting function, you can set alert rules for some inappropriate usage behaviors, such as sending alerts to users who have been inactive for a long time.
- It can be easily integrated with third-party systems, whether it is extracting data from Elasticsearch to other data visualization platforms for data visualization, or adding other data sources in the Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard for joint data visualization.

# Features

## Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard

### 1. Organization
> First, based on [List teams of an onganization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams), get all the teams under the Organization, and then based on [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), sum and calculate the data of all teams under the Organization to get complete Organization-level data.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_acceptances_count) / sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptence (Count) = `sum(total_acceptances_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Suggestions (Count) = `sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Lines of Code Accepted = `sum(total_lines_accepted)`
- Acceptance Rate (%) = `total_acceptances_count / total_suggestions_count`
- Total Active Users = `total_active_users`
- Total Suggestions & Acceptances Count = `total_suggestions_count` & `total_acceptances_count`
- Total Lines Suggested & Accepted = `total_lines_suggested `& `total_lines_accepted`

![](image/image_WVNHVnb2OZ.png)

### 2. Teams
> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated by Teams to obtain data comparisons of different Teams.

- Number of Teams = `unique_count(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Team Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(team_slug)`

- Number of Editors = `unique_count(editor)`
- Top Editors by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor)`
- Top Editors by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(editor)`
- Editors Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(editor)`

![](image/image_9P1zJxBMaO.png)

### 5. Copilot Chat

> Based on the data from [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), we can get the usage of Copilot Chat.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_chat_acceptances) / sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptances = `sum(total_chat_acceptances)`
- Cumulative Number of Turns = `sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Total Acceptances | Total Turns Count = `total_chat_acceptances` | `total_chat_turns`
- Total Active Copilot Chat Users = `total_active_chat_users`

![](image/image_chat.png)

### 6. Seat Analysis

> Based on the data analysis of [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization) and [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization), the seat allocation and usage are presented in a unified manner.

- Copilot Plan Type = `count(seats).groupby(plan_type)`
- Total = `seat_breakdown.total`
- Active in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.active_this_cycle`
- Assigned But Never Used = `last_activity_at.isnan()`
- Inactive in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.inactive_this_cycle`
- Ranking of Inactive Users ( ≥ 2 days ) =  `today - last_activity_at`
- All assigned seats = `*`

![](image/image_vNpkYpc-xW.png)

### 7. User Metrics Analytics

> Complete user-level analytics powered by the GitHub Copilot 28-day user metrics report. Track adoption, engagement, and feature utilization with updates every four hours.

Based on the data from [Get Copilot User Metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-user-metrics), this module provides comprehensive per-user analytics including:

#### Summary Panels & Detailed User Analytics

![](image/user-metrics-summary.png)

**Four key metric panels provide at-a-glance insights:**

- **Total Users** = `cardinality(user_login)` - Unique count of users with Copilot activity in the selected time range
- **Total Suggestions** = `sum(code_generation_activity_count)` - Total number of code suggestions generated across all users
- **Total Acceptances** = `sum(code_acceptance_activity_count)` - Total number of code suggestions accepted by users
- **Acceptance Rate** = `sum(code_acceptance_activity_count) / sum(code_generation_activity_count)` - Overall acceptance percentage showing code quality and relevance

**Comprehensive per-user breakdown with sortable columns:**

- **User** - GitHub username/login
- **User Initiated Interactions** = `sum(user_initiated_interaction_count)` - Direct user actions requesting Copilot suggestions
- **Code Suggestions Generated** = `sum(code_generation_activity_count)` - Number of code completions offered to the user
- **Code Suggestions Accepted** = `sum(code_acceptance_activity_count)` - Number of suggestions the user accepted
- **Average LOC Suggested** = `avg(loc_suggested_to_add_sum)` - Average lines of code suggested per interaction
- **Average LOC Added** = `avg(loc_added_sum)` - Average lines of code actually added from suggestions
- **Agent Usage** = `sum(used_agent)` - Count of Copilot Agent feature usage (GitHub Copilot Workspace, CLI, etc.)
- **Chat Usage** = `sum(used_chat)` - Count of Copilot Chat interactions
- **Active Days** = `cardinality(day)` - Number of distinct days the user engaged with Copilot

#### Activity Visualizations & Top 10 Users Leaderboard

![](image/user-metrics-charts.png)

**Two time-series charts show engagement patterns:**

**Daily Active Users:**
- Line chart showing unique user count per day
- Helps identify usage trends, peak days, and adoption velocity
- Formula: `cardinality(user_login)` per day

**Code Generation & Acceptance Activity:**
- Dual-line chart comparing suggestions generated (green) vs accepted (yellow)
- Reveals code quality trends and user satisfaction over time
- Green line: `sum(code_generation_activity_count)` per day
- Yellow line: `sum(code_acceptance_activity_count)` per day

**Horizontal bar chart showcasing top performers by adoption percentage:**

- **Adoption Score** = `(active_days / $__rangeDays) × 100` - Percentage of the distinct active days inside the range you have selected in Grafana (the denominator is computed from Grafana’s `$__rangeDays` so it matches 30, 90, 365-day filters automatically).
- The Top 10 panel now runs directly on `copilot_user_metrics`, counts the unique `day` values per user inside the range, and normalizes by the computed range length (`$__rangeDays`). That way the percentage re-scales whenever you change the dashboard period even though the raw documents still come from repeated 28-day API snapshots stored in Elasticsearch.
- Color-coded gradient indicating engagement level:
  - 🔴 Red (0-40%): Needs attention - may require training or support
  - 🟠 Orange (40-60%): Moderate usage - room for improvement
  - 🟡 Yellow (60-80%): Good engagement - regular user
  - 🟢 Green (80-95%): Excellent adoption - heavy user
  - 🔵 Blue (95-100%): Power user - Copilot champion candidate

**Automated Data Collection:**
- Runs immediately at startup and every four hours (configurable via `EXECUTION_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
- Fetches 28-day rolling window data from GitHub API
- Calculates adoption scores automatically
- Stores in 2 Elasticsearch indexes: `copilot_user_metrics` (raw data) and `copilot_user_adoption` (leaderboard scores)
- No manual intervention required

**Use Cases:**
- Identify power users and champions for Copilot evangelism
- Track onboarding progress for new Copilot users
- Spot users who need additional training or support
- Measure team-level adoption trends over time
- Monitor Chat and Agent feature adoption rates
- Correlate active days with productivity metrics
- Generate executive reports on Copilot ROI

### 8. AI Tokens Billing

For enterprise slugs (`standalone:YOUR_ENTERPRISE_SLUG`), the updater creates an `ai_credit` billing usage report using GitHub's `2026-03-10` API, obtains its report ID, polls for completion, and downloads the CSV. If a report already exists (HTTP 409), it reuses a matching export. The previous calendar month is requested by default; set both `GITHUB_BILLING_START_DATE` and `GITHUB_BILLING_END_DATE` to choose another period. The billing row uses the `copilot_ai_billing` Elasticsearch index and follows Grafana's Organization and time-range filters. Report generation or missing CSV rows can leave the panels empty until a completed export is available.

| Panel | Data shown |
|-------|------------|
| AI Credits | Sum of AI credits consumed from the CSV quantity fields |
| Gross Cost | Sum of `gross_amount` before discounts |
| Input Tokens | Sum of the CSV `input` values |
| Output Tokens | Sum of the CSV `output` values |
| AI Credits Over Time | AI credits by each CSV row's `date` |
| Top Users | Highest AI-credit usage by CSV `username` |
| By Model | AI-credit usage by CSV `model` |
| AI Billing CSV Details | Raw billing rows, with `date` and `username` first, followed by the remaining CSV columns |

Token counts, AI credits, and monetary cost are separate measures. The CSV details table exposes the original report fields for reconciliation; it is not a second billing total.



### 1. Copilot Seat Info & Top Languages

- You can view the distribution of seats, Enterprise or Business? and overall activation trends. And for users who don't use Copilot, they are ranked based on the length of inactivity and list users who have never activated.
- Ranking Language and Teams based on usage
